								Join us for dinner and a talk by Kathleen Moore from Whitepages. She is a graduate from the University of Washington (2014) with a BS in Computer Engineering. She interned with Whitepages prior to her Senior year and then joined as a full-time employee after graduation. Kathleen works on the Whitepages.com team as a full-stack engineer.					
								<br><br>Her talk will be focused on exploring what it means to be a true full-stack developer. We will touch on Kathleen's background, technologies that Whitepages uses and how, as well as what you can do to better prepare yourself for a similar role. We will also touch on recruiting within the Seattle area and suggestions on how to land your first job/internship.

								<td><h3>MadHacks</h3>
								WACM has partnered with MadHacks, UW-Madison's national hackathon! 
								<br><br>Unlike other hackathons, MadHacks puts an emphasis on the wacky, the original, and the downright impossible! Like the mad geniuses, tinkerers, makers, and designers preceding us, we want to test our boundaries like never before! We're reaching out to the highly dedicated risk-takers, the envelope pushers, and the daredevils. We hope to produce a new kind of hackathon: where the winners are chosen by the hackers, and the sponsors feel like they are right in the middle of the hacker community itself - rather than on the outside looking in.
								<br><br>Please see <a href="https://www.madhacks.org/" target="_blank">MadHack's website</a> for more information.

								<td><h3>Lunch with ARM</h3>
								Please join us for lunch with ARM, a leading microprocessor intellectual property company. Two ARM employees, Liana Nicklaus and Adam Sperling, will be in attendance to answer all your questions about the company, preparing for a career in the semiconductor industry, life after school, employment opportunities, and anything else you can think to ask! 
								<br><br>
								Liana graduated from the University of Illinois in 2014 and has been at ARM two years. She works on the System-on-Chip integration or "Kits" team. Her team gathers IP from all around ARM (interconnect, DMCs, CPUs, and more) and stitches them into an SoC. This enables them to run performance evaluations and test suites to ensure the IPs work well together. Adam graduated from UW - Madison with degrees in ECE and CS in 2014, and an MS in CS in 2016. After two internships with ARM in 2013 and 2014, he started full time last June. He currently makes use of fast model simulators and emulators doing full system validation using operating systems. In the past, he has worked on both verification and RTL design for Cortex A57 and A72.
